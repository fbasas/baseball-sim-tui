## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Python + Textual: Rich data ecosystem, modern TUI framework, fast iteration
- SQLite bundled: No external dependencies, works offline, fast queries
- At-bat level (not pitch-by-pitch): Better pacing, sufficient realism for management sim
- Research existing sim algorithms: Leverage decades of prior art rather than inventing from scratch

### Pending Todos

None yet.
